# SunriseSunsetReact

My first attempt to do a frontend in React. 
It was modeled to have the same functionality as [SunriseSunsetVue](https://github.com/timanatimana/SunriseSunsetVue) and
it consumes the same .NET backend [SunriseSunset.NET](https://github.com/timanatimana/SunriseSunset.NET)
State is managed with the `useReducer()` hook.

## Try it out live

I deployed this project on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 
Have a look and try it out: [SunriseSunsetReact - Live](https://sunrise-sunset-react.netlify.app)
