# SunriseSunsetReact

My first attempt to do a frontend in React. 
It was modeled to have the same functionality as [SunriseSunsetVue](https://github.com/timanatimana/SunriseSunsetVue) and
it consumes the same .NET backend [SunriseSunset.NET](https://github.com/timanatimana/SunriseSunset.NET)
State is managed with the `useReducer()` hook.
